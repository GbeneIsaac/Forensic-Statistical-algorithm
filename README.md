# Forensic-Statistical-algorithm
The Forensic-Statistical Algorithm is an innovative tool designed to address algorithmic bias in forensic source identification, a critical area in modern crime detection and investigation. This algorithm combines statistical modeling with machine learning techniques to evaluate and reduce potential biases that arise when analyzing forensic evidence, such as DNA, fingerprints, and other trace materials. By doing so, it seeks to ensure that forensic conclusions are both accurate and fair, minimizing the risk of wrongful convictions or other errors that could arise from skewed data or flawed methodologies. The algorithm operates by identifying patterns and inconsistencies in how forensic evidence is processed and interpreted, enabling investigators to make more informed and objective decisions. Both synthetic and real data were used to test the performance of the algorithm(UPDATEDRMEPMVT(2).R).

Beyond improving accuracy, the Forensic-Statistical Algorithm serves as a diagnostic tool to expose and mitigate systemic biases in forensic science. It highlights how demographic, environmental, or procedural variables may disproportionately influence the interpretation of evidence, potentially disadvantaging certain groups. By introducing transparency into the forensic process, the algorithm fosters greater accountability in criminal justice practices. Furthermore, its application provides a foundation for the development of best practices in evidence handling and analysis, ensuring that advancements in forensic science are aligned with principles of equity and scientific integrity. This tool not only supports investigators in solving crimes but also strengthens public trust in forensic methodologies by promoting fairness and reducing errors.
